## Macros Documentation

### define CAPABILITY

```
#define CAPABILITY RunMC
```

Get a list of all the PID pairs related to active process codes. 

Collider sim event capability.

Collider sim capability.

Output some info about the event loop.

Calculate the total LHC log likelihood.

Extract the indices for the SRs used in the analysis loglikes (alphabetical SR ordering)

Extract the labels for the SRs used in the analysis loglikes.

Extract the combined log likelihood for each analysis to a simple map_str_dbl.

Extract the log likelihood for each SR to a simple map_str_dbl.

Calculate the log likelihood for each SR in each analysis using the analysis numbers.

Extract the signal predictions and uncertainties for all analyses.

Collect all the analysis numbers in one place.

A map between PID pairs and cross-sections.

Execute the main Monte Carlo event loop. Note: "Non-loop" capabilities that some in-loop capabilities depend on can be added as dependencies here to ensure that they are calculated before the loop starts.

Total cross-section

Output info on TotalCrossSection as a str-double map, for easy printing

Process codes and PID pairs

Get list of Pythia process codes for all active processes

Translate a list of Pythia process codes to list of (PID,PID) pairs for the two final state particles of the hard process.

Process-level cross-sections

A map between Pythia process codes and cross-sections

Output PID pair cross-sections as a str-dbl map, for easy printing

A consistency check that ensures that if each event is weighted by a process-level cross-section from an external calculator, then the total cross-section is taken from the event generator

Lists of analyses to run

Run all analyses and fill vector of analysis results.

Dummy observable that creates a dependency on TestModel1D, which is used to satisfy the normal GAMBIT model requrements in a minimal way. This is useful in the case where we just want to test ColliderBit on a single point with Pythia's SLHA interface, but not use the ColliderBit standalone interface.

Detector sim capabilities.

Run detector simulators and produce the standard event format.

Provide functions that can be used for event weighting, e.g. for process-level cross-section scaling. {@

Event weight functions that depend on model-specific Py8Collider versions should be declared in the corresponding model header in ColliderBit/models. 


### define FUNCTION

```
#define FUNCTION operateLHCLoop
```

Example function for interfacing alternative cross-section calculators. 

A nested function that reads in HepMC event files and converts them to HEPUtils::Event format.

Only activate these functions if HepMC is activated.

Weight events according to process cross-section.

Convert the TotalEvGenCrossSection (type MC_xsec_container) into a regular TotalCrossSection (type xsec_container)

A function that reads the total cross-section from the input file, but builds up the number of events from the event loop

A function that assigns a total cross-sections to a given SLHA input file (for model ColliderBit_SLHA_file_model)

A function that assigns a total cross-sections directly from the scan parameters for model ColliderBit_SLHA_scan_model

This function is intended as a fallback option that simply assigns a unit weight to all events

A nested function that reads in Les Houches Event files and converts them to HEPUtils::Event format
