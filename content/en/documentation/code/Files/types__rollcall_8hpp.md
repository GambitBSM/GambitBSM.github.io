## Detailed Description


List of headers that define classes, typedefs and so forth needed for module, model and backend co-operation with the GAMBIT core. If you need to add a new type, how you do this depends on what the type is associated with. Guidelines are given below.

Bear in mind throughout that normal C/C++ rules apply: if your new type is never going to be used except as a local convenience in your new module/backend/model, then there is no need to do anything more than put it in a header and 

```cpp
#include 
```

 that from wherever you plan to use it, as per standard programming practice. You should only have to bother with the instructions below if GAMBIT or its other modules/backends/models need to be aware of this new type. That would typically be the case when your new type is to be used in more than one module/backend/model, or if it is to be used for passing things back and forth between modules, 

 backends and/or models, e.g. if it is the result or argument type of a backend function, module function or module dependency.

Explicit instructions for adding new types:


## MODELS

To add a new type that will be used exclusively to communicate with some model X, declare it in a header Models/include/gambit/Models/model_types/X_types.hpp, and include that file from Models/include/gambit/Models/models/X.hpp. X_types will be automatically included in Models/include/gambit/Models/model_types_rollcall.hpp by the GAMBIT model harvester.


## MODULES

To add a new type that will be used exclusively to communicate with some module Y, declare it in a header Y/include/gambit/Y/Y_types.hpp, and include that file from Y/include/gambit/Y/Y_rollcall.hpp. Y_types will be automatically included in Elements/include/gambit/Elements/module_types_rollcall.hpp by the GAMBIT module harvester.


## BACKENDS

To add a new type that will be used to communicate with a backend Z, declare it in a header Backends/include/gambit/Backends/backend_types/Z_types.hpp Z_types will be automatically included in Backends/include/gambit/Backends/backend_types_rollcall.hpp by the GAMBIT backend harvester.


## MIXED-USE TYPES

If the type will be used by multiple modules, multiple models or multiple backends, or any mixture thereof, make some header Elements/include/gambit/Elements/__your_header_name__.hpp that declares the type, and include that header by hand from [Elements/include/gambit/Elements/shared_types.hpp](/documentation/code/files/shared__types_8hpp/#file-elements-shared-types-hpp).


## PRINTING

Remember also that if you want to be able to spit instances of your new type out to a file or other output medium, you will need to add specialisations for it in the various printers included in Utils/include/gambit/Utils/printers_rollcall.hpp.
