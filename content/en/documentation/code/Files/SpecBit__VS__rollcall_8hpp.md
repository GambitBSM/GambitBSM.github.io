## Macros Documentation

### define CAPABILITY

```
#define CAPABILITY lnL_EW_vacuum
```

Tunnelling likelihood (including contributions set by panic_vacua) 

Model dependent capabilities.

Initialize vevacious with a set of [YAML](/documentation/code/namespaces/namespaceyaml/) runOptions.

Get all vevacious results from a vevacious run as str to dbl map to print them.

Create a string set containing a list with all panic vacua for the vacuum stability likelihood VS_likelihood

Create a string set containing a list of all tunnelling strategies for the vacuum stability likelihood VS_likelihood

If tunnelling to global and nearest vacuum are requested, this capability compares if the two vacua are the same. Return true if they coincide, false if not.

Function for computing the stability of the scalar potential w.r.t. global minimum. Model independent. Just works with a filled instance of SpectrumEntriesForVevacious for the respective Model. calls two non-rollcalled helper functions: helper_run_vevacious & helper_catch_vevacious

Name and locations of the ini files for Vevacious for each model, since they might not be just <MODELNAME>.vin, etc.

Function to create an object of type SpectrumEntriesForVevacious, holding all spectrum entries that have to be passed to vevacious (via SLHAea). Model dependent. Note that the actual execution of the passing is done in a non-rollcalled helper function (exec_pass_spectrum_to_vevacious) to allow for several vevacious runs per parameter point.
