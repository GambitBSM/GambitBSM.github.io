## Macros Documentation

### define CAPABILITY

```
#define CAPABILITY RunMC
```

Get a list of all the PID pairs related to active process codes. 

Calculate the log likelihood for each SR in each analysis using the analysis numbers.

Extract the signal predictions and uncertainties for all analyses.

Di-jet likelihoods.

Collect all the analysis numbers in one place.

A map between PID pairs and cross-sections.

Execute the main Monte Carlo event loop. Note: "Non-loop" capabilities that some in-loop capabilities depend on can be added as dependencies here to ensure that they are calculated before the loop starts.

Total cross-section

Output info on TotalCrossSection as a str-double map, for easy printing

Process codes and PID pairs

Get list of Pythia process codes for all active processes

Translate a list of Pythia process codes to list of (PID,PID) pairs for the two final state particles of the hard process.

Process-level cross-sections

A map between Pythia process codes and cross-sections

Output PID pair cross-sections as a str-dbl map, for easy printing

A consistency check that ensures that if each event is weighted by a process-level cross-section from an external calculator, then the total cross-section is taken from the event generator

Lists of analyses to run

Run all analyses and fill vector of analysis results. 


### define FUNCTION

```
#define FUNCTION operateLHCLoop
```

Example function for interfacing alternative cross-section calculators. 

Convert the TotalEvGenCrossSection (type MC_xsec_container) into a regular TotalCrossSection (type xsec_container)

A function that reads the total cross-section from the input file, but builds up the number of events from the event loop

A function that assigns a total cross-sections to a given SLHA input file (for model ColliderBit_SLHA_file_model)

A function that assigns a total cross-sections directly from the scan parameters for model ColliderBit_SLHA_scan_model

Translate a list of Pythia process codes to list of (PID,PID) pairs for the two final state particles of the hard process.

Process-level cross-sections

A map between Pythia process codes and cross-sections

Output PID pair cross-sections as a str-dbl map, for easy printing

A consistency check that ensures that if each event is weighted by a process-level cross-section from an external calculator, then the total cross-section is taken from the event generator

Lists of analyses to run

Run all analyses and fill vector of analysis results. 


### define FUNCTION

```
#define FUNCTION operateLHCLoop
```

Example function for interfacing alternative cross-section calculators. 

Convert the TotalEvGenCrossSection (type MC_xsec_container) into a regular TotalCrossSection (type xsec_container)

A function that reads the total cross-section from the input file, but builds up the number of events from the event loop

A function that assigns a total cross-sections to a given SLHA input file (for model ColliderBit_SLHA_file_model)

A function that assigns a total cross-sections directly from the scan parameters for model ColliderBit_SLHA_scan_model 


### define CAPABILITY

```
#define CAPABILITY RunMC
```

Get a list of all the PID pairs related to active process codes.

Di-jet likelihoods.

Collect all the analysis numbers in one place.

A map between PID pairs and cross-sections.

Execute the main Monte Carlo event loop. Note: "Non-loop" capabilities that some in-loop capabilities depend on can be added as dependencies here to ensure that they are calculated before the loop starts.
