### Introduction

Evidence for new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) could appear in any observable in particle, astroparticle or nuclear physics. This means that if a BSM model is to be proven or disproven it is necessary to analyse the data from many different experimental sources simultaneously. Global fits attempt to tackle this problem, combining theoretical observable predictions with targeted searches of experimental data.

GAMBIT, the Global And Modular BSM Inference Tool, is one of a number of global fitting software frameworks. However, GAMBIT is designed to offer a number of advantages over existing solutions including theory flexibility, straightforward extension to new observables and external interfaces, code availability, statistical secularism and computational speed.

Gambit consists of a number of 
modules or `Bits`, along with various Core components and utilities
