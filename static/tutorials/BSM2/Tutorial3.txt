INSTRUCTIONS FOR TUTORIAL 2
===========================

** Assuming you have followed the Pre-tutorial steps **

Requirements
------------

* Modules: SpecBit, DecayBit, DarkBit, GUM
* Scanners: diver
* Backends: CalcHEP, MicrOmegas
* Other: Mathematica (FeynRules)

Running GUM
-----------

* First the model needs to be known to gum

    mkdir Models/MDMSM
    mv Tutorial/MDMSM.fr Models/MDMSM

* Run the gum file

    ./gum -f Tutorial/MDMSM.gum

  This will take a while

Re-build GAMBIT
---------------

* GUM will give you the instructions on how to rebuild GAMBIT, in this case

    cd ../build
    cmake ..
    make calchep micromegas_MDMSM

* Do not build gambit yet as we also need to build other things for the scan

   make diver
   cmake ..
   make ddcalc
   make gamlike
   make darksusy_generic_wimp
   make -j4

Model
-----

* MDMSM_Tute.yaml (get form the gum/Tutorial directory)
  Parameters: mchi, mY, gchi, cY
  Likelihoods: lnL_oh2, lnL_FermiLATdwarfs, LUX_2016_LogLikelihood, XENON1T_2018_LogLikelihood

Running scan
------------

* Run scan with various MPI process for speed

    mpirun -np 4 ./gambit -f yaml_files/MDMSM_Tute.yaml

  And just wait... (this could take about 12 hours)

Check results
-------------

* Results are written in the "output" directory (e.g. runs/MDMSM/samples)

    h5ls runs/MDMSM/samples/MDMSM.hdf5

Plotting results
----------------

* To generate plots we use pippi
  Pippi file: MDMSM.pip

    ./pippi/pippi gum/Tutorial/MDMSM.pip

* Best fit point is printed in the parse directory (e.g. runs/MDMSM/parse)

    less runs/MDMSM/parse/MDMSM.best_all

* Plots are generated in the selected plots directory (e.g runs/MDMSM/plots)

    okular runs/MDMSM/plots/*
